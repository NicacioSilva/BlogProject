Adam before the FallIn words of peculiar simplicity, the Bible introduces the first man and the woman whom God providedto be his helpmeet. These two were joined as one and in the divine consideration the unit is that whichis formed by this union. Both the man and the woman sinned and fell, but this combined fall is referredto in the Bible as the fall of man. No calculations are possible as to the length of time in which the firstman and first woman remained unfallen; but they remained unfallen long enough, it is evident, tobecome accustomed to the situation in which they were placed, to regard carefully and name the livingcreatures, and to have experienced fellowship with God. It is said that man as created, like all the worksof God, was \"very good\"; that is, they were well pleasing to the Creator. This implies no more than thatthey were innocent, which is a negative term and suggests that they had not committed sin. Holiness,which is the primary attribute of God, is a positive term and indicates that He is incapable of sinning.While man was made in the image of God in respect to personality and spiritual capacity, he was andis a creature. And though the Creator, being holy, cannot sin, the creature, whether it be angel or man,is by the divine plan in creation made with the ability to sin. Among the angels, Satan sinned (Ezekiel\r\n28:15; Isaiah 14:12-14), and many other angels sinned, of whom it is written that they \"kept not theirfirst estate\" (Jude 1:6). We should also observe that, in reality, man did not originate sin; it wasrecommended by Satan and adopted by man (Genesis 3:4-7). By this action, the moral nature ofman\u2014intellect, sensibilities, and will\u2014is manifested, and, hearing the voice of God, his conscienceprompted him to hide from the divine presence. It is therefore clear that at the beginning man was inpossession of these faculties as he is today.II. Adam after the FallBy sinning, the first man lost his blessed estate as he was created and became subject to certainfar-reaching changes:1. He became subject to both spiritual and physical death. God had said, \"In the day that thoueatest thereof thou shalt surely die\" (Genesis 2:17); and this divine declaration was fulfilled. Adamand Eve passed immediately into spiritual death, which means separation from God. In due timethey also suffered the penalty of physical death, which means the separation of the soul from thebody.2. The very creation itself was changed by the sin of man. Briars and thorns were introduced, laborand sorrow were added, and the enjoyment of Eden was withdrawn.III.", "publish": "2020-04-23T20:03:54", "created": "2020-04-23T20:11:08.361", "updated": "2020-05-11T10:58:58.582", "status": "published"}}, {"model": "BlogApp.post", "pk": 4, "fields": {"title": "Declaring Your Greatness", "slug": "declaring-your-greatness", "author": 1, "body": "God, my Father, you are so good to Your sons and daughters.

It is evident, however, that he did not lose his heavenly position, the larger portion of his power, or his access to God.\r\n\r\n2. Satan's Judgment through the CrossThrough the cross a perfect judgment has been secured (John 12:31; 16:11; Colossians 2:14, 15), but the execution of that sentence is yet future. This sentence with its execution was predicted in the Garden of Eden (Genesis 3:15).\r\n\r\n3. Satan will be cast out of heaven in the midst of the coming Tribulation and as a result of a war in Heaven, Satan will be cast out of heaven and be limited to the earth. He will then act in great wrath knowing that he has but a short time to continue (Revelation 12:7-12. Note, also, Isaiah 14:12; Luke 10:18).\r\n\r\n4. Satan will be confined, to the AbyssFor the thousand-year reign of Christ upon the earth, Satan will be sealed in the abyss, after which he must be loosed for a \"little season\" (Revelation 20:1-3, 7).\r\n\r\n5.
